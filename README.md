## Features

- Support [ERC-4337: Account Abstraction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337)
- [Modular design ](https://hackmd.io/3gbndH7tSl2J1EbNePJ3Yg)
- Upgradability: The smart contract for this wallet can be upgraded in a secure way to add new features or fix vulnerabilities in the future.
- Stablecoin pay gas: Users can pay transaction gas fees with stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, DAI, etc.

## Architecutre

The smart contract comprises three main logic components:

1. SoulWallet Core:

- This is the primary wallet logic.
- Supports the ERC4337 interface.
- Manages modules and hooks.

2. Modules:

- Modules provide extended functionality.
- A module is a whitelisted contract capable of executing transactions on behalf of the smart contract wallet.
- Modules enhance the functionality of the contracts by adding extra access logic for transaction execution.

3. Hooks:

- A hook is essentially a function or a set of functions that are called at specific points within a contract's execution flow.
- Hooks can be set up to perform additional checks on transactions before they're executed.

## Repository Structure

All contracts are held within the `soul-wallet-contract/contracts` folder.

## Test

```shell
npm run test
```

## Integration

Third parties can build new modules/plugins on top of SoulWallet to add additional functionality.

### Module

To add a new module, the contract should inherit from BaseModule. BaseModule is an abstract base contract that provides a foundation for other modules. It ensures the initialization, de-initialization, and proper authorization of modules.

```solidity
import "./BaseModule.sol";

contract NewModule is BaseModule {
    function requiredFunctions() external pure override returns (bytes4[] memory)
    {
        // return wallet functions that modules need access to
    }

     function inited(address wallet) internal view virtual override returns (bool) {
        // Implement your checking logic
    }

    function _init(bytes calldata data) internal virtual override {
        // Implement initialization logic
    }

    function _deInit() internal virtual override {
        // Implement de-initialization logic
    }
}

```

### Hook

To integrate a new hook, your contract should inherit `IHook` interface. This interface will define the standard structure and functionalities for your hooks.

```solidity

import {IHook} from "@soulwallet-core/contracts/interface/IHook.sol";

contract NewHook is IHook {
     function preIsValidSignatureHook(bytes32 hash, bytes calldata hookSignature) external view {
        // Implement hook logic
     }


    function preUserOpValidationHook(
        UserOperation calldata userOp,
        bytes32 userOpHash,
        uint256 missingAccountFunds,
        bytes calldata hookSignature
    ) external {
        // Implement your hook-specific logic here
    }
}
```
